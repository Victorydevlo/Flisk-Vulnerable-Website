A deliberately vulnerable web application built for cybersecurity training and CTFs. Includes OWASP Top 10 flaws like SQL injection, XSS, IDOR, and privilege escalation. Features realistic scenarios and Linux-based tasks for hands-on exploitation and learning.

üîê Vulnerable Web Application for Security Training & CTF Challenges This project is a deliberately vulnerable web application designed for educational purposes, cybersecurity training, and Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. It simulates a realistic environment with multiple layers of vulnerabilities and integrated Linux-based tasks, offering learners and professionals hands-on experience in discovering, exploiting, and mitigating common web and system security flaws.

üß∞ Key Features OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities, including:

SQL Injection (SQLi)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

Broken Authentication & Session Management

Security Misconfiguration

Privilege Escalation

User Role Simulation ‚Äî including regular users and admins with access control flaws.

Linux Interaction Layer ‚Äî users can engage with a backend Linux environment for system-based challenges (e.g., file privilege escalation, enumeration).

Flag-Based System ‚Äî designed for CTF-like progression, users can submit flags to score points.

Real-World Structure ‚Äî mimics a basic e-commerce or login-based portal to reflect common attack surfaces.

Logging and Scoreboard (optional) ‚Äî track user activity and performance.

üéì Ideal For Ethical hacking students

CTF participants and organizers

Security researchers and penetration testers

Cybersecurity educators and trainers
